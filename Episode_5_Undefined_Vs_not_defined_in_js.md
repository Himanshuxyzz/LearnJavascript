#### # Undefined vs not defined

---

In memory creation phase all variables are first assigned with an special placeholder which is known as undefined until values are assigned undefined is stored in variable.

> // Example :-
> `console.log(a);` //undefined because values are not assigned but in memory `a` is allocated
> `var a = 10;` > `console.log(x)` //not defined beacause this variable is not in the memory space

`undefined != 'empty'`

Javascript is loosely typed language it means it doesn't attaches varaible to any special data type.

Loosely type language also known as weakly type language.
